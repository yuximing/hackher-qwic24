# RightOvers
Leftovers done right!
This is a hackathon project done at hackHer held by Queen's Women in Computing in March 2024.

## Inspiration
Food insecurity is a very prominent issue in our community and worldwide, so we wanted to address this issue efficiently yet simply.

## What it does
The solution that we came up with was a website called RightOvers: leftovers done the right way. A person who ends up having leftover food (perishable or not) can drop it off at a location for someone else in need, or they could also pick up a meal if they need it.

## How we built it
Our web application is mainly built with React JS, HTML and CSS.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about stages of developing a website. From learning how to use React.js, to finding out how to integrate Google Maps in a way that keeps it fully interactive for our users.

## What's Next for Rightovers
We aim to continue expanding our website and keep improving it. Our goal is to partner with food banks, the KFLA, and perhaps even more food industries to have the most impact on this issue.
